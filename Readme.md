Skel Files for Linux Machines
=============================
This is a collection of skeleton directories for various projects in the Linux
world. Below is an exhaustive list of the type of projects included: 

  * C (cproj)
	* Latex (texproj)

Project Build Systems 
---------------------
Most of the projects included default to using make as the build system. This is
to provide standardization across most linux platforms. If a different build
system is found in a skeleton file then read the README.md file for that project. 

Project Dependencies 
--------------------
Build dependencies are various amoung the projects. Read the README file for
each skeleton directory for the needed default dependencies. See below for a
known list of dependencies (assume the lastest version for each):

	* gnu make
	* gcc
